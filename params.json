{"name":"cironka","tagline":"Linke ditore","body":"## What's coming next for this daily?\r\n\r\nNext I'm implementing some sort of search functionality. So, you enter a term like \"WebGL\" and the entire database is filtered by that term.\r\n\r\n## Is there an RSS feed?\r\n\r\nNope. It'll come eventually.\r\n\r\n## When are new dailies released?\r\n\r\nWeekdays around 5 pm ECT (European time).\r\n\r\n## Where is the data stored?\r\n\r\nIn Markdown files, which makes it open source. You're free to use the data anyhow you like.\r\n\r\n## What goes into creating a daily?\r\n\r\nI gather the content from Twitter, i.e. from the tweets of the ~130 people I follow on Twitter. Usually, I select around 40-50 tweets (potential entries). Then, based on those tweets I create around 20-30 entries for the daily.\r\n\r\n## What topics are covered?\r\n\r\n - Open Web Platform (including the open standards that comprise it)\r\n - JavaScript (the core language and libraries written in it)\r\n - web-browsers (including their development tools)\r\n - front-end web-development in general\r\n - open source to some degree (e.g. GitHub related content)\r\n - openness (open data)\r\n - privacy\r\n\r\n## How do you decide what goes into a daily?\r\n\r\nThe general rule is that the content should be recent (say, less than 2 weeks old) and relevant for the majority of visitors.\r\n\r\n## May I suggest content?\r\n\r\nSure. Just mention [@simevidas](http://twitter.com/simevidas) on Twitter.","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
